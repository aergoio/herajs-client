 * Smart contract interface.
 * You usually instantiante this class by using one of the static methods.
 * Most of the instance methods return the contract so they can be chained.
 * When an ABI is loaded, its functions will be added to the instance and can be called directly.
 * ABI functions return `FunctionCall` objects that can be queried or called.
 *
 * .. code-block:: javascript

 *     aergo.queryContract(contract.someAbiFunction()).then(result => {
 *         console.log(result);
